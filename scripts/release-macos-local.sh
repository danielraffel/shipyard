# Build, sign, notarize, AND TEST the macOS shipyard binary on this Mac.
#
# Motivation (#219): CI-signed + Apple-notarized binaries shipped in
# v0.42.0 and v0.43.0 both SIGKILL'd with "Taskgated Invalid Signature"
# on the primary maintainer's Mac — even though they passed CI's own
# launch gate on a GH Actions macOS-15 runner. That strongly suggests
# the problem is either (a) CI's signing pipeline producing a ticket
# that's subtly different from what Apple returns for the same cert
# locally, or (b) a per-Mac Gatekeeper/taskgated state that won't
# accept tickets from a specific CI environment.
#
# This script is "Option B" from the #219 discussion: take signing
# completely off CI and put it on the Mac that's actually going to
# run the binary. The build is deterministic in the sense that the
# PyInstaller flags match CI's exactly — only the environment is
# different. If the locally-built+signed binary launches cleanly
# here, that's definitive proof CI signing was broken.
#
# Even more important per user instruction: THIS SCRIPT TESTS THE
# BINARY AFTER NOTARIZATION AND BEFORE UPLOAD. No asset uploads if
# `--version` doesn't print. That's the whole point — if CI did
# this we'd have caught v0.42.0 before it shipped.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release-macos-local.sh [--tag vX.Y.Z] [--upload] [--arch arm64|x64]
#
# Env vars required for notarization:
#   SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APPLE_ID           (Apple ID email)
#   SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_TEAM_ID            (Developer Team ID, e.g. 95CX6P84C4)
#   SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APP_PASSWORD       (app-specific password from appleid.apple.com)
#   SHIPYARD_SIGNING_IDENTITY            (SHA-1 fingerprint OR subject CN of Developer-ID cert)
#
# Flags:
#   --tag vX.Y.Z   Assume the current commit is tagged vX.Y.Z.
#                  Defaults to `git describe --tags`.
#   --upload       Upload the signed+tested asset to the GitHub release
#                  for --tag. Without this, the script only builds and
#                  verifies — useful for diagnosing without shipping.
#   --arch         Build for arm64 (default) or x64. The host CPU is
#                  what you'll actually get; x64 needs Rosetta or a
#                  different host.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   Build + sign + notarize + local-launch test all passed.
#       Asset was uploaded if --upload was passed.
#   1   One of the steps failed. Diagnostics on stderr.
#   2   Missing required env var.
#   3   --version smoke test FAILED on this Mac. Do NOT ship this binary.
