# Releasing Shipyard

## Quick path: `shipyard release-bot setup`

The guided command is the primary way to wire up `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` — it detects current state, recommends the right PAT path (fresh per-project PAT vs reusing one you already have), opens the pre-filled creation URL, stores the secret via `gh secret set`, and then dispatches a real workflow run to prove `actions/checkout` accepts it. One command replaces the manual steps below.

```sh
shipyard release-bot status                # what's configured, is it rejected?
shipyard release-bot setup                 # guided wizard
shipyard release-bot setup --paste         # skip wizard; just (re-)paste a token
shipyard release-bot setup --reconfigure   # replace existing secret value
shipyard release-bot setup --shared-name shipyard-release-bot  # one PAT across repos
shipyard release-bot setup --siblings other/repo --siblings other/repo2  # hint existing peers
```

If the wizard can't run (headless, no `gh`, etc.), the manual steps below remain the fallback.

## One-time setup: `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` secret

The auto-release workflow needs a fine-grained PAT to push tags so that downstream `release.yml` actually fires. **Without this secret, auto-release silently degrades**: tags are still created via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, but GitHub Actions deliberately does not chain workflows from `GITHUB_TOKEN`-pushed tags (anti-infinite-loop safety), so `release.yml` never runs and no binaries ship.

Run `shipyard doctor` to check whether the secret is configured. If it shows `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN: missing`, set it up:

1. **Generate the token.** github.com → top-right avatar → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → **Fine-grained tokens** → Generate new token.
2. **Token name:** `shipyard-release-bot` (or any descriptive name).
3. **Expiration:** 1 year (mark your calendar to renew).
4. **Resource owner:** the org or user that owns this repo.
5. **Repository access:** *Only select repositories* → include the repo(s) where this PAT will be used as `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN`. **Why this is strict:** fine-grained PATs are authorized per-repo; GitHub enforces that `actions/checkout@v5` can only use the PAT against repos explicitly listed here. If you add the PAT as a secret to a second repo that isn't listed, auto-release fails on that repo with `fatal: could not read Username`.

   **Which repos belong here?** Just the project(s) whose `auto-release.yml` will use this token — typically *your own project*, not the Shipyard repo itself. You're setting up release automation for the codebase *using* Shipyard, not for Shipyard's own releases (unless you maintain a Shipyard fork).

   **Multi-project tip:** if you run Shipyard on multiple projects and want one rotation point, list them all here and use `shipyard release-bot setup --shared-name shipyard-release-bot` on each. Easier to rotate once; wider blast radius if the token leaks. Default per-project PATs are least privilege.
6. **Permissions** (Repository permissions section): **Contents: Read and write** is required. **Metadata: Read-only** is auto-added (required baseline). Optional: **Workflows: Read and write** only if you plan to commit changes to `.github/workflows/*` under this token — Shipyard's auto-release only pushes tags, so it's not required.
7. **Generate**, copy the token (starts with `github_pat_…`). The token is shown once and cannot be retrieved later.
8. **Add to repo secrets, on every consumer repo.** The PAT's "Selected repositories" list only authorizes the token to *operate against* those repos; you still have to store the token *value* as a secret named `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` on each repo separately. The fastest way is one `gh` command per repo:

   ```sh
   # Paste the token once, then Ctrl-D, for each repo:
   gh secret set RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN --repo <owner>/<repo-A>
   gh secret set RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN --repo <owner>/<repo-B>
   ```

   Or via the web UI: github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions → **New repository secret** → name `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN`, paste value.

**If auto-release is failing with `fatal: could not read Username`,** there are two independent causes to check:

1. **PAT scope:** edit the existing token at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens → add the failing repo to **Selected repositories** → **Update**. No secret re-set needed; the stored value stays valid.
2. **Secret value drift:** the `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` secret on this repo holds a *different* token than the one you expanded in step 1. This happens when the secret was seeded from an earlier PAT that was later revoked or replaced. Re-run `gh secret set RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN --repo <owner>/<repo>` with the current token value.

Both can be true at once. Verify by checking the timestamp of the secret (`gh secret list --repo <owner>/<repo>`) against the last token regeneration time on https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.

That's it — no code change needed. The workflow already reads `${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. `shipyard doctor` will then report `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN: configured`.

### What if you can't or don't want to set the secret?

The chain still works but requires one manual step per release:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --ref v<x.y.z>
```

Run that after the auto-tag appears. The release workflow will pick up the existing tag and publish the binaries. (Pulp's first auto-released tag, `v0.4.0`, used this fallback before its `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` was provisioned.)

## macOS release is a locally-signed + stapled .dmg

**As of 2026-04-24 evening, macOS binaries ship as stapled `.dmg` artifacts built on the maintainer's Mac.** This supersedes the "bare Mach-O, notarized at release" path used through v0.43.0.

**What we learned** (issue [#219](https://github.com/danielraffel/Shipyard/issues/219)):

1. **CI-signed bare Mach-O binaries (v0.42.0, v0.43.0):** passed every CI check — `codesign --verify`, `spctl --assess`, an on-runner launch gate running `--version` under the signed+notarized state — and still SIGKILL'd with "Taskgated Invalid Signature" on the maintainer's Mac. We originally blamed CI signing.
2. **Locally-signed bare Mach-O (v0.43.0 re-upload):** worked the first time, then SIGKILL'd a few hours later on the same Mac with the same bytes. The delta wasn't CI vs local — it was that **bare Mach-O binaries depend on an online notarization check at launch**, and that check is unreliable on some Macs (contention, Apple CDN state, macOS 26.3+ `com.apple.provenance` enforcement, or all three).
3. **Stapled `.dmg`:** the only durable fix. A `.dmg` wrapper carries the notarization ticket **inside** the artifact. When macOS mounts the dmg, Gatekeeper verifies the ticket **offline**. The binary extracted from the mount inherits "trusted origin" provenance. No online check, no per-Mac flakiness, no dice rolls. End-to-end verified working on the same Mac that rejected every earlier artifact.

### How to cut a macOS release

CI handles Linux + Windows. For the macOS `.dmg`:

```bash
# One-time setup — either .env or shell rc.
export SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APPLE_ID=<apple-id-email>
export SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_TEAM_ID=<team-id>              # 10-char from developer.apple.com/account
export SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APP_PASSWORD=<app-specific>    # appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security
export SHIPYARD_SIGNING_IDENTITY=<SHA1-or-CN>           # `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`

# After release.yml workflow publishes non-macOS assets:
./scripts/release-macos-local.sh --tag vX.Y.Z --upload
```

The script is 8 steps:

1. Fail fast on missing env vars (before the ~60s PyInstaller build).
2. Build via `pyinstaller --onefile --codesign-identity <...>`.
3. Re-sign outer Mach-O with `--options runtime --timestamp`.
4. Package the signed Mach-O into a `.dmg` (`hdiutil create`, volname "Shipyard").
5. Sign the DMG itself.
6. Submit to Apple, wait for `status: Accepted`, then `xcrun stapler staple` and `xcrun stapler validate`.
7. **Local launch test** — mount the stapled DMG read-only, run `<binary> --version`. Refuses to upload if this fails. Distinguishes exit 3 (local launch broke) from exit 4 (download path broke).
8. **End-to-end verification after upload** — runs the local `install.sh` against the just-uploaded tag. Downloads the dmg, mounts, extracts, launches. Exit 4 if this fails, with a warning that the upload already happened and needs manual deletion.

### Lesson codified

We shipped v0.42.0 and v0.43.0 with the same class of breakage because we declared "works" based on partial verification. The release script now enforces what we should have been doing all along: **the only success criterion is `--version` printing after a fresh install.sh → mount → extract → launch flow**. If any step in that chain fails, the release fails, regardless of what `codesign --verify` or `spctl --assess` say.

### Why the repo secrets stay

The five secrets below are kept in the repo even though CI doesn't use them today — they're needed for:

- Future Rosetta-hosted local cross-builds for x64
- Forks that may re-enable CI signing for their own environments
- The `.dmg` pipeline above reuses `SHIPYARD_SIGNING_IDENTITY` conceptually (the cert is in the local keychain rather than a GH secret, but the same cert)

Five secrets on the repo (all `gh secret set NAME`):

### How to cut a macOS release

CI still handles Linux + Windows. For the macOS binary:

```bash
# One-time setup — either .env file or shell rc.
export SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APPLE_ID=<apple-id-email>
export SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_TEAM_ID=<team-id>              # 10-char from developer.apple.com/account
export SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APP_PASSWORD=<app-specific>    # appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security
export SHIPYARD_SIGNING_IDENTITY=<SHA1-or-CN>           # `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`

# After the release.yml workflow publishes the non-macOS assets:
./scripts/release-macos-local.sh --tag vX.Y.Z --upload
```

The script runs the full pipeline on the local Mac:

1. Fails fast if any env var is missing (before the ~60s PyInstaller build).
2. Builds via `pyinstaller --onefile --codesign-identity <...>` — identical flags to what CI used to do, only the environment differs.
3. Re-signs outer Mach-O with `--options runtime --timestamp` (notarytool prerequisites).
4. Submits to Apple via `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`, asserts `status: Accepted`.
5. **Runs `<binary> --version` locally.** If this fails (the #219 shape), exits 3 with `codesign --verify`, `spctl --assess`, and `xattr -l` diagnostics, and does NOT upload. This is the whole point — the Mac running the script is the same Mac that will need to launch the binary tomorrow.
6. On launch success: uploads via `gh release upload --clobber` and updates `checksums.sha256` for the artifact.

Running without `--upload` is the diagnostic mode (used to confirm the local signing path actually works on a given Mac). Test coverage in `tests/test_release_macos_local.py` ensures missing creds / bad flags / bash syntax errors all surface before the expensive build step.

### Why the repo secrets are still listed below

The CI signing steps have been removed from `.github/workflows/release.yml` (build-only for macOS, no signing / notarizing / uploading). The five secrets below are kept in the repo for:

- The x64 slice once we add Rosetta-hosted local cross-builds or move x64 to local too
- Future `.dmg` stapling pipeline (task #52 — the long-term answer that eliminates Apple's online-check dependency entirely)
- Forks that might want to re-enable CI signing for their own environments

Five secrets on the repo (all `gh secret set NAME`):

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email (same one used for Developer ID certificate) |
| `TEAM_ID` | 10-char Team ID from [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account) |
| `APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password generated at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords |
| `SIGNING_CERT_P12_BASE64` | `base64 -i DeveloperID.p12` of your exported Developer ID Application cert + private key |
| `SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD` | Export password for the .p12 |

When **all five** are set, the release workflow's macOS matrix jobs import the cert into a temp keychain, resolve the Developer ID Application identity by **Team ID** (via `security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "(TEAM_ID)"` — not by subject CN, so forks / org-owned certs / maintainer rotation all work), pass the resulting SHA-1 fingerprint to PyInstaller's `--codesign-identity` so every embedded dylib (notably `Python.framework`) gets signed at collection time, then re-sign the outer Mach-O with `--options runtime --timestamp` and submit to `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`. Users downloading a signed binary get clean execution on macOS 26.3+ with no xattr dance.

The gate is all-five-present (not just `APPLE_ID`). A partial rotation — say a new `APPLE_ID` pasted in but the new `SIGNING_CERT_P12_BASE64` not yet uploaded — used to run the signing path and fail mid-release on `base64 -d`. Now the step cleanly no-ops in that state and the ad-hoc fallback publishes normally.

**Why PyInstaller has to see the identity, not just the post-build step.** An earlier iteration signed only the outer Mach-O after PyInstaller had already bundled an ad-hoc-signed `Python.framework` inside. dyld's "same Team ID" check then rejected the load at first launch:

```
code signature … not valid for use in process: mapping process and mapped file
(non-platform) have different Team IDs
```

Passing `--codesign-identity` during the PyInstaller build is what makes the inner and outer Team IDs match. The outer re-sign step remains because PyInstaller doesn't add `--options runtime` / `--timestamp` itself, and notarytool requires both.

When the secrets aren't set, the sign+notarize step no-ops and the workflow continues to publish ad-hoc-signed binaries (the current default). Forks and pull requests from external contributors aren't blocked.

A bare Mach-O can't be `stapler staple`'d — Gatekeeper verifies notarization online at first launch instead. That requires network, which every CI / user machine has. Accepted tradeoff vs wrapping the CLI in a no-op `.app` bundle just for stapling.

## Preferred runner provider

Shipyard's own CI defaults to the runner provider configured in the repo variable `DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER`. Set it once:

```sh
gh variable set DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER --repo danielraffel/Shipyard --body namespace
```

Every subsequent PR push, tag push, and scheduled release picks that up without workflow edits. Per-run overrides still work via `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch> -f runner_provider=github-hosted`.

**Why Namespace is the preferred default:** GitHub-hosted `macos-15` queues routinely stall shipyard PRs for 10+ minutes during business hours. Namespace's cloud pool (profiles `namespace-profile-generouscorp`, `-macos`, `-windows`) has near-zero queue time and faster macOS ARM machines. The trade-off is per-minute cost — Namespace is not free like GitHub-hosted on public repos — but for an active project the wall-clock-time savings are worth it.

**When to flip back to `github-hosted`:**
- Forks / external contributors whose repos don't have the variable set will naturally fall through to `github-hosted` (safe default, no paid surface exposed).
- If Namespace has an outage: `gh variable delete DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER` restores `github-hosted` for all future runs without a workflow PR.

The resolution order per target in `ci.yml` / `release.yml` is:
1. `workflow_dispatch` input (per-run override — all targets).
2. `vars.DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER_LINUX` / `_MACOS` / `_WINDOWS` (per-target repo variable).
3. `vars.DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER` (repo-wide default).
4. Hardcoded fallback `github-hosted`.

**Per-target override use case:** If one Namespace profile goes down (e.g. `generouscorp-windows` saturated 2026-04-23, #193) you can route just that platform to `github-hosted` without losing the speed benefit on the healthy profiles:

```sh
gh variable set DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER_WINDOWS --repo danielraffel/Shipyard --body github-hosted
```

Every subsequent run builds Linux + macOS on Namespace and Windows on `windows-latest`. Delete the variable when the outage clears:

```sh
gh variable delete DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER_WINDOWS --repo danielraffel/Shipyard
```

## Default path: automatic on merge

Normal releases are automatic. You don't call any script.

1. Open a PR via `shipyard pr` (or `shipyard ship`).
2. CI runs `.github/workflows/version-skill-check.yml`, which confirms the right bump(s) are present via `scripts/version_bump_check.py` + `scripts/skill_sync_check.py`. Merge on green.
3. On push to `main`, `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` diffs `pyproject.toml`'s version against the previous push. If it moved, the workflow creates a `v<x.y.z>` tag.
4. The existing tag-triggered `release.yml` builds binaries on 5 platforms and publishes the GitHub Release.

Plugin-version bumps (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) are intentionally **not** tagged — plugin files are delivered from git, not from the binary. Bumping the plugin version still requires a PR and goes through the same gate, but it doesn't cut a binary release.

## Patch-level auto-bumps (rollup gap fix)

By default the version-bump gate only auto-applies **minor** and **major** verdicts. Patch-level changes (internal fixes, Codex-review cleanups) land as "patch-suggested" — advisory only. In a run of fix-only PRs, nothing gets auto-released until a minor-class change happens to merge.

Enable per-surface auto-patch-apply in `scripts/versioning.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "surfaces": {
    "cli": {
      "auto_apply_patch": true    // fix-only PRs now bump + release
    }
  }
}
```

When true, `apply_bumps()` treats patch verdicts like minor/major: rewrites the version files, commits, pushes. The tag-release chain fires normally.

When false (default), `shipyard doctor` surfaces the drift: latest `vN.N.N` tag vs count of CLI-surface commits since that tag on main. At or above the threshold (default 3) it reports `tag_drift` as not-ok so maintainers know to bump before the gap widens. Shipyard's own repo has `auto_apply_patch: true` on `cli`; the plugin surface stays off (git-delivered, no binary).

See issue #70 for the design discussion.

## When to go manual

Only when the automatic flow is genuinely unavailable:

- The auto-release workflow is disabled or broken.
- An emergency hotfix needs direct tag control (rare — prefer a PR even for hotfixes).

### Manual fallback

```bash
./scripts/release.sh patch    # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 (bug fixes)
./scripts/release.sh minor    # 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 (new features)
./scripts/release.sh major    # 0.1.0 → 1.0.0 (breaking changes)
./scripts/release.sh 0.3.0    # explicit version
```

The script:

0. Runs `scripts/version_bump_check.py --mode=report` and refuses to tag if the required bumps aren't present. `RELEASE_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` bypasses this for emergencies; log a reason in the commit trailer.
1. Bumps the version in `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and plugin manifests
2. Commits the version bump
3. Tags the commit (`v0.1.1`)
4. Pushes the tag
5. The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` which:
   - Builds binaries on 5 platforms (macOS ARM64/x64, Windows x64, Linux x64/ARM64)
   - Creates a GitHub Release with binaries + SHA256 checksums
   - Uses GitHub-hosted runners by default; Namespace via manual dispatch

## Monitoring a release

```bash
# Watch the build
gh run list --repo danielraffel/Shipyard --limit 3

# Check the release page
gh release view v0.1.1 --repo danielraffel/Shipyard
```

## Using Namespace runners for a release build

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo danielraffel/Shipyard -f runner_provider=namespace
```

## Version locations

The version lives in 4 places (all updated by `release.sh`):

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `pyproject.toml` | `version = "X.Y.Z"` |
| `src/shipyard/__init__.py` | `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"` |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |

## Versioning convention

- **Patch** (0.1.x): bug fixes, small improvements
- **Minor** (0.x.0): new features, new commands, new ecosystem detectors
- **Major** (x.0.0): breaking changes to config format, CLI output schema, or behavior

The `--json` output schema has its own version (`schema_version` field) that
increments independently when the output format changes.
