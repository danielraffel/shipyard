"""Tests for ``shipyard pin show`` + ``shipyard pin bump`` (#222).

These tests drive the CLI with a fake consumer repo layout (a tmp
directory containing ``tools/shipyard.toml``, ``tools/install-shipyard.sh``,
and a fake ``pyproject.toml`` that does NOT name the package
"shipyard"). The Shipyard-repo refusal path is exercised by pointing
at a fake pyproject that DOES.
