"""Tests for doctor's `gh-scope` probe (#236).

`shipyard cloud retarget --apply` + `cloud handoff run --apply` need
`workflow` scope on the gh token to cancel runs. Pre-fix, the user
only discovered the missing scope mid-retarget with a bare
"Couldn't cancel the matching job(s)" error. The doctor probe
surfaces it before that happens.

Scope detection semantics covered here:
  - gh not installed → probe returns None (silent; the `gh` row
    already covers install state)
  - gh logged out → probe returns None (unrelated to scope)
  - classic PAT with workflow scope → ok=True
  - classic PAT without workflow scope → ok=False + fix command
  - fine-grained / GitHub App (no Token scopes line) → neutral pass
    with a clarifying message (scopes not inspectable locally)
