"""Daemon reconcile skips aged-terminal PRs.

Reconcile fetches `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` for every
active ship-state every 30s. With 60+ states the budget blows past
5000/hr. Most of those 60 are long-settled (terminal runs, last
touched days ago). Skip reconcile for states that are BOTH:

  - all dispatched_runs in a terminal status (or evidence_snapshot
    entries all terminal for legacy states with empty runs), AND
  - `updated_at` older than 1 hour (past the fresh window).

Fresh terminal states still get reconciled — preserves the
"reconcile heals a CI re-run that just completed" path that
test_reconcile_emits_events.py depends on. The fresh window is
short enough that webhook events reset it on any real state change,
keeping the safety net intact.

Task #22.
