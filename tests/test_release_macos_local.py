"""Tests for scripts/release-macos-local.sh (#219 Option B).

Can't actually exercise codesign / notarytool / PyInstaller from
pytest — those require real Apple credentials + a signing identity
in the keychain. What we CAN exercise is:

- Help text renders
- Missing --tag fails with exit 2 and a clear message
- Missing env vars fail with exit 2 BEFORE any build work starts
  (critical: the build burns ~60s; failing fast on missing creds
  saves the operator that time)
- The script is syntactically valid bash
