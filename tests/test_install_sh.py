"""Tests for the environment-variable contract of install.sh.

install.sh's default install location and version resolution are what
downstream consumers (Claude Code plugin's auto-installer, Codex one-
liner, project pinners like pulp) depend on. Regressions here either
fragment the install footprint (multiple shipyard binaries in
different places) or break version-pinned installers.

We drive install.sh with ``SHIPYARD_DRY_RUN=1`` which skips the
network + filesystem work and prints the resolved config as
KEY=value pairs. Platform detection (OS=macos/linux/windows) is
whatever host runs the test; we only assert invariants that hold on
every platform.

    # Codex P1 on #227: my earlier RELEASE_URL grep anchored with
    # just `"` after `${ARTIFACT}`, which worked for Linux + macOS
    # bare Mach-O (where the asset name ends right before the
    # closing quote) but broke Windows — `shipyard-windows-x64.exe`
    # has `.exe` between ARTIFACT and the quote. The fix allows an
    # optional `.exe` suffix.
    #
    # Drive install.sh through the RELEASE_URL branch with a fake
    # windows-x64.exe asset. We can't actually RUN a .exe on
    # macOS/Linux, but we CAN verify the URL-resolution step picks
    # the right asset and gets through the download step. Skip the
    # final smoke since the stub isn't a real Windows binary.
