# CI Operations with Shipyard

Shipyard coordinates validation across local, SSH, and cloud targets.

## Quick reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Validate current branch | `shipyard run --json` |
| Validate specific targets | `shipyard run --targets mac,ubuntu --json` |
| Fast smoke check | `shipyard run --smoke --json` |
| Full ship (PR + validate + merge) | `shipyard ship --json` |
| Ship to develop instead of main | `shipyard ship --base develop --json` |
| Resume an interrupted ship | `shipyard ship --resume --json` (auto when state exists) |
| Force-restart a stale ship | `shipyard ship --no-resume --json` |
| List in-flight ship states | `shipyard ship-state list --json` |
| Inspect one PR's ship state | `shipyard ship-state show <pr> --json` |
| Live-tail the active ship | `shipyard watch` (or `shipyard watch --pr <n>`) |
| One-shot snapshot | `shipyard watch --no-follow --json` |
| Merge on green (cron-safe one-shot) | `shipyard auto-merge <pr>` (0=merged, 1=fail, 2=not-found, 3=in-flight) |
| Diagnose RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN | `shipyard release-bot status --json` |
| Configure RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN | `shipyard release-bot setup` (guided) |
| Re-paste token after rotation | `shipyard release-bot setup --paste` |
| Live-probe the release chain | `shipyard doctor --release-chain` (dispatches + waits) |
| Show queue and status | `shipyard status --json` |
| Show all queued jobs | `shipyard queue --json` |
| Show run logs | `shipyard logs <job_id> --json` |
| Show logs for one target | `shipyard logs <job_id> --target windows` |
| Check merge readiness | `shipyard evidence --json` |
| Bump job priority | `shipyard bump <job_id> high` |
| Cancel a job | `shipyard cancel <job_id>` |
| List cloud workflows | `shipyard cloud workflows --json` |
| Show cloud defaults | `shipyard cloud defaults --json` |
| Dispatch a cloud workflow | `shipyard cloud run build --json` |
| Dispatch only if remote matches HEAD | `shipyard cloud run build --require-sha HEAD --json` |
| Retarget one lane on an in-flight PR | `shipyard cloud retarget --pr <n> --target macos --provider namespace` (dry-run; add `--apply`) |
| Skip a version-bump gate | `shipyard pr --skip-bump sdk --bump-reason "docs only"` |
| Skip a skill-sync gate | `shipyard pr --skip-skill-update ci --skill-reason "mechanical"` |
| Inspect tracked cloud runs | `shipyard cloud status --json` |
| Environment check | `shipyard doctor --json` |
| Clean up artifacts | `shipyard cleanup --apply` |

## Ship workflow (the main flow)

1. Work on a feature branch. Commit your changes.
2. Run `shipyard ship --json` — this pushes, creates a PR, validates on all
   platforms, and merges when green.
3. If a target fails, read the logs with `shipyard logs <id> --target <name>`,
   fix the issue, and run `shipyard ship --json` again.

Shipyard refuses to merge unless every required platform has passing evidence
for the exact HEAD SHA.

### Recovering an interrupted ship

If a ship was interrupted (laptop closed, session ended, OS restart), just
run `shipyard ship --json` again. Shipyard writes per-PR state to disk on
every dispatch and evidence event; the second invocation auto-resumes from
the same run IDs without re-dispatching. On SHA or merge-policy drift the
resume is refused with a clear message — re-run with `--no-resume` to
archive the stale state and start fresh. Full details in
[`docs/ship-resume.md`](../../docs/ship-resume.md).

## Queue management

When multiple jobs are queued (common with parallel worktrees):

- `shipyard queue --json` — see what's running and pending
- `shipyard bump <id> high` — make a job run next
- `shipyard bump <id> low` — deprioritize a job
- `shipyard cancel <id>` — cancel a pending or running job

## Target configuration

Targets are defined in `.shipyard/config.toml`:

```toml
[targets.mac]
backend = "local"
platform = "macos-arm64"

[targets.ubuntu]
backend = "ssh"
host = "ubuntu"
platform = "linux-x64"

# Optional fallback chain
fallback = [
    { type = "cloud", provider = "namespace", repository = "owner/repo", workflow = "build" },
]
```

There is no `shipyard config` or `shipyard targets` subcommand yet. Inspect
target definitions in `.shipyard/config.toml` and `.shipyard.local/config.toml`,
and use `shipyard status --json` for live target state.

## Troubleshooting

- `shipyard doctor --json` — checks git, ssh, gh, nsc are installed
- `shipyard status --json` — shows configured targets, queue state, and live target status
- `shipyard logs <id> --target <name>` — full log for a failed target
- If a target is unreachable with no fallback, it reports unreachable
- `shipyard run --allow-unreachable-targets --json` — override preflight if you intentionally want to queue anyway
- `shipyard cloud defaults --json` — inspect the current cloud workflow/provider dispatch plan

## Shipping a PR (the `shipyard pr` path)

When the user says "push a PR", "ship this", "ship it", "we're done", "merge this", or "push it" — run `shipyard pr` (or the `/pr` slash command — see `commands/pr.md`). It wraps `shipyard ship` with the versioning gates: skill-sync check, version-bump apply, and a `chore: bump versions` commit before handing off to the push/PR/validate/merge flow.

The orchestration, in order:

1. `scripts/skill_sync_check.py --mode=report` — hard-fails if a mapped path was touched without a `SKILL.md` update or a `Skill-Update:` trailer on the tip commit.
2. `scripts/version_bump_check.py --mode=apply` — rewrites `pyproject.toml` + `src/shipyard/__init__.py` for CLI-surface bumps and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for plugin-surface bumps. The two version streams are independent per `RELEASING.md`.
3. `git commit` + `gh pr create` + `shipyard ship`.
4. On merge, `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` tags the CLI bump as `v<x.y.z>`. The existing tag-triggered `release.yml` builds the 5-platform binaries and publishes the GitHub Release.

Never run `gh pr create` + release separately. Never run the Python gate scripts by hand.

## Bypass trailers (tip commit)

| Gate          | Trailer                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version bump  | `Version-Bump: <surface>=<patch\|minor\|major\|skip> reason="..."` |
| Skill update  | `Skill-Update: skip skill=<name> reason="..."`              |
| Auto-release  | `Release: skip reason="..."`                                 |

**Gotcha:** anything under `.github/workflows/**`, `.claude-plugin/**`, `commands/**`, `agents/**`, `hooks/**`, `scripts/release.sh`, `src/shipyard/cli/**`, `src/shipyard/runners/**`, or `src/shipyard/config/**` triggers the `ci` skill's path map (`scripts/skill_path_map.json`). Update this SKILL.md in the same PR — or use the `Skill-Update: skip` trailer with a real reason.

**Manual release fallback:** `./scripts/release.sh` still exists for emergencies but is no longer the happy path. Normal releases flow through `shipyard pr` → merge → auto-release workflow.

**`RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` is required for the auto-release chain to fire.** Without it, auto-release silently degrades — tags get created via `GITHUB_TOKEN` but GitHub doesn't trigger workflows on `GITHUB_TOKEN`-pushed tags, so `release.yml` never runs and no binaries ship. Run `shipyard doctor` to check; if the secret is missing, follow the "One-time setup" section in `RELEASING.md`. `shipyard pr` will also print a heads-up before pushing the PR if the secret isn't present.
