# Shipyard

## Core Rule

Preserve the user's active Shipyard install and rollback path. Rust Shipyard is
the daily implementation as of `v0.51.0` / `v0.51.1`, but do not replace
`/Users/danielraffel/.local/bin/shipyard`, remove preserved backups, change
Pulp pins, reset Tailscale Funnel, or merge GUI cutover support without a clear
go/no-go for that operation.

## First Steps

1. Confirm the active repo and dirty state with `git status --short`.
2. Use RepoPrompt for code analysis across Shipyard, historical shipyard-rust,
   and the macOS GUI before declaring parity or implementation gaps.
3. Read the current planning packet before making release/cutover claims:
   `planning/post-cutover-status.md`, `planning/go-no-go-completion-audit.md`,
   `planning/upstream-drift.md`, `planning/documentation-backlog.md`, and
   `docs/plan/README.md`.
4. Use `--mode isolated`, temporary install directories, and sandbox HOME/PATH
   roots for rehearsals that must not touch the active production state.

## Drift And Parity

Run drift checks whenever Python Shipyard may have changed:

```sh
python3 scripts/update_drift_tracker.py
```

Only advance the baseline with `--mark-reviewed` after the new upstream changes
have been audited and reflected in Rust or explicitly risk-accepted.

Compare command surfaces safely:

```sh
python3 scripts/compare_cli_surface.py \
  --python-bin /Users/danielraffel/Code/shipyard/.venv/bin/shipyard \
  --rust-bin target/release/shipyard \
  --allow-rust-only paths
```

Run the finish-line credential gate before signing or release claims:

```sh
python3 scripts/finish_line_status.py \
  --env-file /Users/danielraffel/Code/PlunderTube/.env \
  --json
```

## Runner Watchdog (self-hosted runner recovery)

Shipyard ships a `runner` subcommand family for detecting and recovering from
stuck self-hosted GitHub Actions runner state. Built after the 2026-05-12
incident where a UBSan job from a closed branch wedged Pulp's local runner for
>75 min while 17 stale queued runs piled up behind it, blocking PR #1859 for
hours.

### When to reach for it

- Runner reports `busy=true` to GitHub but no Worker process running locally
- Worker process running >90 min on a job that should take ~20-30 min
- Queue depth growing while runner appears stalled
- Stale queued runs from closed/rebased branches monopolizing the runner

### Safe commands (read-only or advisory)

- `shipyard runner status` — one-shot health check, exit 0/1/2, `--json` supported
- `shipyard runner cleanup --dry-run` — list stale queued runs without cancelling
- `shipyard runner watch` — advisory daemon mode, polls every 5 min

### Mutating commands (require explicit flags)

- `shipyard runner cleanup --fix` — cancel stale queued runs (1s gap between cancels)
- `shipyard runner watch --fix` — auto-recovery loop (cron-friendly)
- `shipyard runner kill --pid X --reason "..."` — kill a specific Worker; requires typed `KILL` confirmation

### `runner kill` recovery sequence

10 steps, all reversible. **Nothing is destroyed.**

1. Snapshot kill event to `~/.shipyard/kill-recovery.jsonl`
2. Typed `KILL` confirmation (skip with `--yes`)
3. SIGTERM with 10s grace (configurable via `--grace-secs`)
4. SIGKILL only if still alive
5. Reap orphaned children (`cmake|ninja|make|ctest|build`)
6. **Move** (not delete) partial `build*` dirs to `/tmp/shipyard-killed-builds/<event-id>/`
7. Verify `Runner.Listener` health via `pgrep`
8. Poll GitHub for status flip to `completed`/`failure`
9. Optional `--retrigger` re-queues the killed PR's CI
10. Print recovery summary with `--recover` invocation hint

A misclick costs ~2 min of cmake re-configure. To recover:
`shipyard runner kill --recover <event-id>` walks the quarantined `build*` dir
back to `_work/<repo>/` and re-queues the killed run.

### Gotchas

- The watchdog's `busy=true but no Worker process` check has a brief 1-5 min
  false-positive window after `cleanup --fix` cancels a run — the runner needs
  time to gracefully exit. Don't double-cancel.
- `runner kill --pid` REFUSES non-Runner.Worker PIDs as a safety check. Override
  via `--runner-dir` only if your install path is non-standard.
- The `concurrency: cancel-in-progress: true` workflow setting SHOULD auto-cancel
  on force-push but doesn't always (Pulp issue #1884). The watchdog's stale-queue
  detection catches the consequences.

### Config

Per-machine overrides in `.shipyard.local/config.toml`:

```toml
[runner.watchdog]
runner_id = 1763
runner_dir = "/Users/me/actions-runner"
max_job_min = 90
max_queue_age_hours = 2
watch_interval_seconds = 300
auto_fix = false
```

## Supervised Subprocess Marker (issue #266)

Every `git` / `gh` child process spawned by the supervised
`pr` / `ship` / `auto-merge` / `overflow` / `wait` flows is launched
with `SHIPYARD_PR_RUNNING=1` in its environment. Downstream tooling
(notably Pulp's pre-push hook in `danielraffel/pulp#1406`) uses this
to distinguish a Shipyard-orchestrated push from a raw `git push`.

When adding a new subprocess spawn site inside one of those flows,
route through the helpers in `src/supervised.rs`:

- `crate::supervised::gh_supervised(gh_command)` instead of
  `Command::new("gh")` (mirrors the existing `gh(gh_command)`
  helper in `src/pr.rs`).
- `crate::supervised::git_supervised()` instead of
  `Command::new("git")`.
- `crate::supervised::supervised(cmd)` when wrapping an
  injection-style `git_command.map_or_else(..., Command::new)`
  pattern (see `src/branch.rs` for the precedent).

Diagnostic subcommands (`doctor`, `pin`, `runner`, `cleanup`,
`cloud`, `governance`, `release_bot`, `reconcile`) deliberately
skip the marker — they are not "supervised pushes" per the
audit-log use case. If you add a brand new orchestrated flow,
extend the scope deliberately rather than blanket-supervising
everything.

## GraphQL Rate-Limit Fallback Behaviour (issue #266)

Five operations detect `is_graphql_rate_limited` in `gh` stderr and
fall through to a REST equivalent: PR list, PR create, PR view, PR
snapshot (in `wait_transport`), and PR merge (in
`app/auto_merge_cmd`). When that happens, `pr::report_rate_limit_fallback(operation, cwd)`
prints a one-line user-visible notice on stderr, including the
GraphQL reset time when a best-effort `gh api rate_limit` probe
succeeds. Add this call to any new REST-fallback dispatch site so
the operator-visible signal stays consistent.

The REST merge path (`merge_pr_rest`) passes the original head SHA
as `-f sha=<oid>` on the PUT so GitHub enforces the merge race-guard
server-side. On a `405 Base branch was modified` response, it
refetches head info via `pr_head_info_rest` and retries exactly once
if and only if the head SHA is unchanged. A changed head SHA means
a new commit landed during the merge attempt — the retry is refused
because the prior green evidence may no longer apply.

## Validation Gates

Prefer non-mutating checks first:

```sh
cargo test --all-targets --locked
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/update_drift_tracker.py
python3 scripts/compare_cli_surface.py --allow-rust-only paths
scripts/validate_webhook_tunnel_live.py --json
```

The live webhook gate is intentionally dangerous because it resets the local
Funnel config:

```sh
scripts/validate_webhook_tunnel_live.py \
  --repo danielraffel/Shipyard \
  --binary "$(command -v shipyard)" \
  --apply \
  --allow-funnel-reset \
  --json
```

Run that only in an approved window where briefly taking over the
machine-global Tailscale Serve/Funnel route is acceptable. The validator knows
about the App Store Tailscale binary at
`/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale`; do not assume a
`tailscale` PATH shim exists.

## macOS GUI

The GUI lives at `/Users/danielraffel/Code/shipyard-macos-gui`. Validate it
against a sandboxed or signed rehearsal artifact before replacing the active
production `shipyard`. Update GUI docs during migration/release work, not
after the fact.

## Platform Notes

Read `references/platforms.md` when work touches Tailscale, live mode,
signing, packaging, Namespace/GitHub Actions runners, Windows SSH/PowerShell,
or cross-platform sandbox E2E behavior.

Namespace is optional and account-dependent. When Namespace is unavailable,
Shipyard should default to GitHub-hosted Linux/macOS/Windows runners or explicit
self-hosted GitHub Actions labels. Do not assume `nsc` access, and do not route
new Shipyard CI to Namespace unless the user explicitly confirms active access.
Do not add hidden repo-variable fallbacks to local/self-hosted macOS runners:
local runner use should be explicit via workflow-dispatch selector inputs so
default GitHub-hosted runs cannot be stolen by stale local runner variables.

For local capacity, keep GitHub Actions as the dispatch layer and use SSH only
to manage the runner hosts. Stable labels such as `shipyard-macos-arm64`,
`shipyard-linux-arm64`, and `shipyard-windows-x64` are preferable to raw host
names in workflow `runs-on` selectors.

## Cloud Retargeting

`shipyard cloud retarget --apply` is intentionally fail-closed. It cancels
matching GitHub Actions jobs first, uses whole-run cancellation only when every
active job in the run matches the target, and does not dispatch a replacement
if cancellation cannot be proven complete. When handling `event=cancel_failed`,
preserve the classification (`auth`, `scope`, `not_found`, `unsupported`,
`transient`, `unknown`), run/job URLs, manual recovery steps, and
branch-protection warning; do not collapse HTTP 404/not-found into an
`actions:write` scope hint unless the raw error also indicates auth or
permission trouble.

## Cutover Discipline

Release/cutover is a human decision, not an implementation side effect. Before
asking for go/no-go, ensure:

- Drift tracker has no untriaged upstream changes.
- CLI surface comparison is clean.
- CI, coverage, sandbox E2E, and GUI validation are green on the current Rust
  commit.
- Tailscale/GitHub live delivery is either passed in an approved reset window
  or explicitly risk-accepted.
- Signing/notarization and rollback paths are validated.
- Documentation changes for Shipyard, GUI, and Pulp/consumer pins are tracked.
