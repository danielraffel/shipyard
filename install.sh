# Shipyard installer — downloads the correct binary for your platform.
#
# Environment variables (all optional):
#
#   SHIPYARD_VERSION   Install a specific version instead of the latest
#                      release. Accepts "v0.22.1", "0.22.1", or "latest".
#                      Default: "latest".
#
#   SHIPYARD_INSTALL_DIR
#                      Where to place the binary + the `sy` symlink.
#                      Default: "${HOME}/.local/bin".
#
#   SHIPYARD_DRY_RUN   When "1", resolve platform + version + install
#                      dir, print them as KEY=value lines, and exit
#                      without downloading or writing anything. Used
#                      by the unit tests; harmless to use manually.
#
# Examples:
#
#   # Default: latest release to ~/.local/bin
#   curl -fsSL https://generouscorp.com/Shipyard/install.sh | bash
#
#   # Pin to a specific version (useful for project-level pins):
#   SHIPYARD_VERSION="v0.22.1" bash install.sh
#
#   # Install somewhere else (e.g. a project-private toolchain dir):
#   SHIPYARD_INSTALL_DIR="${HOME}/.mytools/bin" bash install.sh
#
# The canonical install location is `${HOME}/.local/bin`; the Claude
# Code plugin's auto-install hook, the Codex one-liner, and this
# script all agree on that by default. Override only when you have a
# good reason (e.g. a project wants versioned artifacts side-by-side).

# macOS post-download signature handling.
#
# Two orthogonal problems to handle:
#
# 1. `com.apple.provenance` / `com.apple.quarantine` xattrs from the
#    GitHub download. macOS 26.3+ Gatekeeper SIGKILLs ad-hoc-signed
#    binaries carrying these with "Taskgated Invalid Signature".
#    Always strip them — they're only metadata anyway.
#
# 2. The binary's code signature. Two cases:
#
#    a. Developer-ID-signed + Apple-notarized (shipyard main releases
#       with all 5 signing secrets set — see RELEASING.md). Notarization
#       makes Gatekeeper trust the binary fast (~1s); XProtect skips the
#       deep scan. We must PRESERVE this signature. `codesign --force
#       --sign -` would strip the Developer ID + notarization ticket,
#       defeating exactly the trust we want. On a test install
#       2026-04-23 the ad-hoc re-sign turned v0.35.0's ~1s cold start
#       into a ~6s cold start because XProtect resumed deep-scanning
#       every invocation.
#
#    b. Ad-hoc-signed (forks, local builds, PRs from external
#       contributors where the signing secrets don't propagate). These
#       DO need the `xattr -cr` + local ad-hoc re-sign to stop
#       Taskgated from SIGKILLing them on every launch.
#
# Detection: `codesign -dv` prints `TeamIdentifier=<team>` for
# Developer-ID-signed binaries and `TeamIdentifier=not set` for
# ad-hoc. The presence/absence of a real Team ID is the fastest
# reliable discriminator.

# Post-install smoke test (#219).

# Bare Mach-O binaries on macOS can pass `codesign --verify` and

# notarization tickets can't be stapled to a Mach-O (only to .app
# / .pkg / .dmg), so Gatekeeper falls back to an ONLINE check the
# first time the binary runs. If that check hiccups (network, DNS,
# Apple-side CDN), taskgated rejects launch and the user sees
# exit 137 with zero output. Without this gate the installer
# cheerfully reports "installed" and leaves the user with a dead
# binary; that's exactly #219.
#
# If the smoke fails, try one recovery round (remove provenance
# xattr + force a second launch) before giving up with a specific,
# actionable error message. Skip entirely if SHIPYARD_SKIP_SMOKE=1
# is set — useful for CI that's dispatching its own verification.
