# Rust Shipyard Release And Rollback

Shipyard is Rust-backed by default as of `v0.51.0`. The current
post-cutover release is `v0.51.1`, which includes the `cloud retarget`
cancellation-denial diagnostics from issue `#265`.

This page is now an operator runbook: how to validate the installed
binary, how release artifacts are produced, how to test live webhook
delivery safely, and how to roll back if the Rust CLI or daemon
regresses.

## Current Release Shape

- `shipyard` and `sy` install to `~/.local/bin`.
- Current macOS releases are Apple Silicon only:
  `shipyard-macos-arm64.dmg`.
- Linux x64, Linux arm64, and Windows x64 ship as native standalone
  binaries.
- macOS artifacts must be Developer-ID signed, notarized, stapled into
  a DMG, mounted, extracted, and launch-tested before the GitHub release
  is published.
- The release stays draft until all expected public assets and
  `checksums.sha256` are present and install E2E has passed.

## Validate The Installed CLI

Run these after install, upgrade, rollback, or daemon refresh:

```sh
shipyard --version
sy --version
shipyard --json doctor
shipyard --json doctor --release-chain
shipyard wait release v0.51.1 --repo danielraffel/Shipyard --timeout 60 --json
codesign --verify --deep --strict "$(command -v shipyard)"
```

Expected healthy state:

- `shipyard --version` and `sy --version` report the same release.
- `doctor.ready` is `true`.
- `daemon-version` says the daemon and CLI versions match.
- `doctor --release-chain` reports `release_chain.version:
  checkout-ok` when `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` is configured.
- `wait release` observes the expected release assets from
  `danielraffel/Shipyard`, not from the current checkout's inferred
  repo. Pass `--repo` explicitly when running from a sidecar repo.

## Release Gates

Before publishing a new Shipyard CLI release, run the local gates that
match the change:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --locked
cargo llvm-cov --locked --summary-only --fail-under-lines 75
python3 -m pytest tools/sandbox-e2e/ -q
```

For release candidates, also validate the package/install path in an
isolated sandbox:

```sh
SHIPYARD_BINARY_FOR_TEST="$PWD/target/release/shipyard" \
  python3 -m pytest tools/sandbox-e2e/ -q
```

The Rust cutover rehearsal passed CLI surface parity, 82%+ line
coverage, local unit/script gates, sandbox E2E, signed macOS rehearsal,
GUI validation, release-chain doctor, and live webhook validation before
`v0.51.0` was merged.

## macOS Release

The default tag push creates a draft release with non-macOS artifacts.
The macOS DMG is then produced by either the local maintainer path or
the optional CI signing path.

Local signing remains the primary release path:

```sh
scripts/release-macos-local.sh \
  --tag vX.Y.Z \
  --upload \
  --rollback-tag vPREVIOUS \
  --env-file /path/to/release.env
```

Required environment:

- `SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APPLE_ID`
- `SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_TEAM_ID`
- `SHIPYARD_NOTARIZE_APP_PASSWORD`
- `SHIPYARD_SIGNING_IDENTITY`

The script builds or accepts a supplied binary, signs the Mach-O,
packages a DMG, signs and notarizes the DMG, staples the ticket,
mounts the DMG, runs `shipyard --version`, uploads the macOS artifact,
merges checksums, verifies public asset visibility, and runs
install/upgrade/rollback E2E when a rollback tag is provided.

The optional CI path is gated by `CI_MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true` and
requires the `MACOS_SIGN_*` / `MACOS_NOTARIZE_*` secret set. CI signing
uses an ephemeral keychain and the same `release-macos-local.sh
--ci-mode` orchestration. If CI signing is not enabled, the macOS job is
build-health-only and does not upload an unsigned artifact.

## Webhook And Funnel Validation

Non-mutating preflight is safe anytime:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_webhook_tunnel_live.py \
  --repo danielraffel/Shipyard \
  --binary "$(command -v shipyard)" \
  --json
```

Full live validation creates a temporary GitHub webhook and may reset the
machine-global Tailscale Serve/Funnel route. Run it only when that short
interruption is acceptable:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_webhook_tunnel_live.py \
  --repo danielraffel/Shipyard \
  --binary "$(command -v shipyard)" \
  --apply \
  --allow-funnel-reset \
  --json
```

The validator understands the App Store Tailscale build and probes
`/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale` when PATH shims
are unavailable. A healthy non-mutating pass proves `gh`, `curl`,
GitHub hook read access, DNS, Funnel permission, and current Funnel
status without changing the route.

## GUI And Consumers

The macOS GUI should use the selected CLI path as the source of truth.
When the selected CLI supports `shipyard --json paths`, the GUI can
derive daemon socket, pid, and state paths from that response. Older
Python binaries without `paths` need the legacy production socket
fallback.

Do not update Pulp or other consumer pins as part of a Shipyard release
PR. After the release is published and stable, update consumers through:

```sh
shipyard pin show
shipyard pin bump --to vX.Y.Z
```

Keep consumer pin PRs isolated from unrelated docs or source changes.

## Rollback

Rollback if the new release fails doctor, daemon IPC, GUI selected-CLI
resolution, webhook/Funnel validation, installer E2E, or a consumer
gate.

1. Stop the daemon:

   ```sh
   shipyard daemon stop
   ```

2. Reinstall the last known-good release, or restore a preserved local
   backup binary:

   ```sh
   SHIPYARD_VERSION=vPREVIOUS \
     curl -fsSL https://generouscorp.com/Shipyard/install.sh | bash
   ```

3. Confirm the restored binary:

   ```sh
   shipyard --version
   shipyard --json doctor
   ```

4. Restart the daemon only after the restored CLI is healthy.
5. Point the GUI selected CLI path back to the restored binary if needed.
6. Revert or supersede any consumer pin PRs that targeted the bad
   release.
7. If a just-published GitHub release failed install E2E, return it to
   draft or delete the bad asset before users can install it.

## Deferred Features

Issue `#265` shipped in `v0.51.1`. Its additive-dispatch extension is
still intentionally not implemented because a standalone dispatch may
not satisfy the same stale PR-event required check context.

Issue `#266` remains the next deferred post-cutover candidate:
`SHIPYARD_PR_RUNNING=1` for supervised `shipyard pr` child processes and
clean GraphQL rate-limit backoff. Keep it separate from release
stability work.
