# Profiles & Configuration

Once you're comfortable with Shipyard, profiles let you switch between
different setups with one command.

## The problem they solve

Some days you want local-only validation (fast, free). Other days you need
the full cross-platform proof (Mac + Windows + Linux via cloud). Editing
your config every time is annoying.

## Define profiles once

```toml
# .shipyard/config.toml

[profiles.local]
# Just your Mac. Fast. Free. No network.
targets = ["mac"]

[profiles.normal]
# Mac local + cloud for Windows and Linux
targets = ["mac", "ubuntu-cloud", "windows-cloud"]

[profiles.full]
# Mac local + VMs with cloud fallback for everything
targets = ["mac", "ubuntu", "windows"]
```

## Switch instantly

```bash
$ shipyard config use local          # just my Mac
$ shipyard config use normal         # Mac + Namespace cloud
$ shipyard config use full           # Mac + VMs + cloud fallback
```

## See what's active

```bash
$ shipyard config profiles

  local     mac                                          ← active
  normal    mac, ubuntu-cloud, windows-cloud
  full      mac, ubuntu, windows (+fallback)

$ shipyard targets

  Profile: local

  mac              local        macos-arm64      reachable

  (ubuntu and windows are disabled in this profile)
```

## Global vs project profiles

Profiles work at both levels:

- **Global** (`~/.config/shipyard/config.toml`) — your default setups, shared
  across all projects. Define `local`, `normal`, `full` here once.
- **Project** (`.shipyard/config.toml`) — project-specific profiles that
  override or extend global ones. A project that needs ARM Linux testing
  can add a `release` profile with extra targets.

Switch profiles globally or per-project. `shipyard status` always shows
which profile is active and exactly where each target will run.
