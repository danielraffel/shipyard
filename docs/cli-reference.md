## JSON output

Every command supports `--json` for structured output with a versioned
schema, intended for AI agent consumption:

```bash
shipyard run --json
shipyard ship --json
shipyard status --json
```

The envelope always carries `schema_version: 1` and the command name, so
agents can pin to a stable contract.
