      - ``ssh_unreachable``: raw SSH connect failed (port 22 timeout,

        own — the network / host is down.
      - ``upload_failed``: SSH reached the host but the upload itself
        exited non-zero / timed out / broke mid-stream. Could be
        transient slow-runner behavior; retry-with-backoff helps.
      - ``other``: bundle creation failure, caller misconfig, etc.
