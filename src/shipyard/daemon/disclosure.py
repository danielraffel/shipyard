"""First-run disclosure + operator-facing messaging.

The daemon does things a reasonable user might not have consented to
if they'd been told nothing:

  * Registers a GitHub webhook on every repo it tracks.
  * Starts a Tailscale Funnel — i.e. makes a localhost service
    publicly routable over Tailscale's edge.
  * Stores an HMAC secret in the keychain (macOS) or a 600-perm file.

None of these are destructive, but we should tell the user the first
time each machine starts the daemon, and point them at how to
disable. A one-line ack file at
``<state_dir>/daemon/.first-run-acked`` records that the disclosure
was shown so subsequent starts are quiet.

        `shipyard daemon` will do the following on this machine:

          1. Start a Tailscale Funnel so GitHub can POST webhook events
             to your Mac. Requires Tailscale to be installed with
             Funnel enabled on your tailnet.
          2. Register a GitHub webhook on each repo it tracks so those
             events are delivered. Repos detected from ship-state:
        {repo_lines}
          3. Store a randomly-generated HMAC secret so deliveries can
             be verified (macOS Keychain, or a 600-perm file on Linux).
          4. Open a Unix socket at ~/.pulp/... for local CLI and the
             macOS app to subscribe to live events.

        None of these are destructive. If you'd rather not use live
        mode:

          * Just don't start the daemon. `shipyard watch`, `shipyard
            ship`, and the macOS app all work without it — they fall
            back to polling.
          * Run `shipyard daemon stop` at any time to tear down the
            tunnel and unregister the webhooks.

        This notice is shown once per machine. To see it again, delete
        the marker file at ~/.local/state/shipyard/daemon/.first-run-acked
        (path varies by OS; `shipyard doctor` prints the exact path).
