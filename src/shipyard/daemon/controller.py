        Ordering (changed in v0.26.3 — don't revert to the pre-IPC
        sequence without reading shipyard#26):

          1. Acquire the PID lock.
          2. Load the webhook secret.
          3. Bind the webhook HTTP server on localhost (needs a port
             so the tunnel can target it).
          4. **Start the IPC server immediately.** Subscribers (the
             GUI, `shipyard wait`, `shipyard watch --follow`) can now
             connect for ship-state-list queries and live status
             reads regardless of tunnel state. Before this change,
             any Tailscale hiccup at startup killed the whole daemon
             and the GUI fell back to polling with no recovery until
             a manual restart.
          5. Spawn the tunnel supervisor as a background task. It
             retries the Tailscale probe forever (capped backoff),
             registers webhooks when the tunnel becomes ready, and
             watches for tunnel loss mid-session.
          6. Spawn the reconcile loop (unchanged).

        `start()` only raises on truly-fatal startup errors: PID
        lock contention, port bind failures, or socket setup
        failures. Tunnel-related failures no longer take the daemon
        down — they surface through `_build_status_snapshot` so
        subscribers see an accurate tunnel state.
