"""Decode PowerShell CLIXML error envelopes surfaced by remote
Windows commands over SSH.

When a Windows PowerShell session writes to any non-stdout stream
(``Write-Error``, uncaught exceptions, ``Write-Warning``, etc.) and
the stream is relayed back to the SSH client, the receiving side
sees a payload that starts with the literal bytes ``#< CLIXML``
followed by a PowerShell CLIXML (Common Language Infrastructure
XML) document. The actual human-readable diagnostic — "file in
use," "git exit 1," "missing dependency," etc. — is buried inside
``<S S="Error">…</S>`` elements in that XML, not in plain text.

Pre-decoder, shipyard's summary row looked like::

    ✗ windows: Bundle apply failed: Remote bundle apply failed: #< CLIXML

Which is exactly as useful as the bare ``windows  error  ssh-windows``
row we fixed in v0.28.0. This module closes that gap (#188): if the
stderr buffer starts with the CLIXML sentinel, we extract the error
and warning stream text, decode PowerShell's ``_x000D_``/``_x000A_``
escape sequences back to CR/LF, and hand the caller plain text that
names the actual failure.

Malformed or partially-transferred envelopes fall through to the
original raw text — the pre-decoder behaviour — so we never make a
failure case worse.
