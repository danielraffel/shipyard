"""Windows toolchain helpers for the ssh-windows executor.

Two pieces of Pulp's local_ci.py that the cross-platform SSH executor
needs to match for capability parity:

1. **Host mutex** — when two validation jobs target the same Windows
   machine, they can stomp on each other (shared repo checkout,
   shared build tree, shared VS installation locks). Pulp wraps each
   remote validation in a `System.Threading.Mutex` and blocks if
   another run holds it. Shipyard ports the same pattern here.

2. **Visual Studio instance detection** — on a machine with multiple
   VS installations (Community + BuildTools + Preview, for example),
   CMake picks one non-deterministically. Pulp runs `vswhere.exe`
   before the build and passes the chosen installation path via
   `-DCMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE=...`. It also derives the CMake
   platform (`ARM64` vs `x64`) from `$env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE` so
   ARM64 Windows hosts build native ARM64 binaries rather than
   defaulting to x64 cross-compilation.

Both helpers are pure string builders — they produce PowerShell
snippets that the ssh-windows executor splices into its remote
command. Running the detection is a separate SSH call, so the result
is cached per-host in the executor instance.

    #      exception, so we can CATCH them instead of silently
    #      continuing to the next statement (PowerShell's default
    #      behavior for "setup.sh is not a recognized command" is
    #      to continue, which masks real failures).
    #   2. `$__ShipyardExit` starts at 1. If the body reaches its
    #      own `$LASTEXITCODE` assignment we overwrite with the
    #      body's actual exit code; if it throws before that, the
    #      catch block sets `$__ShipyardExit = 1` explicitly and
    #      writes the exception to stderr. Either way, the final
    #      `exit $__ShipyardExit` ALWAYS runs with an explicit
    #      non-null code. This closes the false-green hole where a
    #      PS exception in the body caused the wrapper to fall
