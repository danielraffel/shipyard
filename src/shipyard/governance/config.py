"""Read governance config from `.shipyard/config.toml`.

Config schema::

    [project]
    profile = "solo"   # or "multi" or "custom"

    [governance]
    # Optional — default derived from project.profile
    required_status_checks = ["macOS (ARM64)", "Linux (x64)", "Windows (x64)"]

    [branch_protection."main"]
    # Explicit overrides on top of the profile default
    require_review_count = 1     # override just this one knob
    enforce_admins       = true

    [branch_protection."develop/**"]
    extends = "main"             # inherit main's overrides
    require_review_count = 0     # but drop the review count

The resolution order for a given branch is:

1. Start with the profile's default rules
2. Apply any `[branch_protection."<glob>"]` overrides for matching globs
3. If a glob has `extends = "<other>"`, apply the base glob's overrides first
4. Last override wins

This module returns a `GovernanceConfig` object plus a helper to
resolve the effective rules for a specific branch name. The
GitHub-side apply logic (in `apply.py`) takes that resolved object
and diffs it against live state.
