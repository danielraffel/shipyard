## Ship code (primary workflow)

When asked to ship, land, or merge code:

1. Ensure changes are committed on a feature branch (never main directly)
2. Run: `shipyard ship --json`
3. This pushes, creates a PR, validates on all configured platforms, and merges on green
4. If any target fails:
   - Run `shipyard logs <job_id> --target <name>` to get the error
   - Report the failure clearly
   - If the fix is obvious, attempt it, commit, and run `shipyard ship --json` again
   - Do not retry more than once without asking the user

## Ship to a different branch

If asked to merge to develop (not main):
- Run: `shipyard ship --base develop --json`

## Check status

- Queue and active runs: `shipyard status --json`
- What passed: `shipyard evidence --json`
- Where things run: `shipyard targets --json`
- All jobs: `shipyard queue --json`

## Manage queue

- Bump priority: `shipyard bump <job_id> high`
- Cancel: `shipyard cancel <job_id>`

## Switch profiles

When asked to "go local", "switch to cloud", or change setup:
- `shipyard config use local` — Mac only
- `shipyard config use normal` — Mac + cloud
- `shipyard config use full` — Mac + VMs + cloud fallback
- Check current: `shipyard config profiles`

## Rules

- Never push directly to main — always use `shipyard ship`
- Never force-merge. Only merge when evidence shows all platforms green.
- All configured platforms must be green before merge
- If the branch is `main`, refuse to operate. Ship from feature branches only.
- Always use `--json` on Shipyard commands so you can parse results reliably
