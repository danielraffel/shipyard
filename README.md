# Shipyard

Shipyard is a cross-platform CI orchestration layer for projects that already build and test. It validates the exact commit across local machines, VMs, SSH hosts, and cloud runners, then gives AI agents structured results they can use to fix failures, retry, and merge only when everything is green.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://generouscorp.com/Shipyard/install.sh | sh
cd my-project
shipyard init        # detects your project, probes your machines
shipyard run         # validates on every platform you configured
```

---

## Who This Is For

You have AI agents writing code across parallel worktrees. When they finish, you want them to validate builds, run tests, open a PR, and merge automatically — only when everything passes.

If something fails, the agent should read the logs, fix the issue, and retry. No babysitting.

Shipyard makes this reliable. Agents commit; Shipyard coordinates validation across platforms; code lands on main  only when all targets are green.

You test with what you already have: your Mac, a UTM or Parallels VM for
Windows and Linux, maybe a Namespace or GitHub Actions account for cloud
runners. Shipyard ties them together — you don't need to set up Jenkins,
maintain a self-hosted runner fleet, or write workflow YAML. Just point it
at your machines and go.

## How It Works

- **Local builds** run directly on your host machine — fast, no network
- **Remote builds** run in separate environments you control — VMs, containers, or machines over SSH (local or on your network; physical location doesn’t matter)
- **Cloud builds** run on managed infrastructure — Namespace, GitHub Actions, etc., for neutral or on-demand capacity

`shipyard run` delivers the exact commit to each machine, runs your build
and test commands, and reports what passed. If a machine is unreachable,
Shipyard can try the next option automatically — boot a VM, or dispatch
to cloud. Or it just reports unreachable and stops. You choose.

`shipyard ship` validates and then creates a PR and merges it.

Shipyard is not a [CI service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), not a [build system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation), not a [workflow engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_engine).
It calls your build commands and cares about one thing: did they pass?

## What Makes It Different

**Exact-SHA validation.** Every target validates the specific commit you
queued, not whatever happens to be checked out. Code is delivered to remote
machines via git bundles — no git credentials needed on the target. Evidence
records bind proof to the exact SHA, so stale results from a prior commit
can't satisfy a merge gate.

**Smart queue for parallel agents.** Multiple agents working in different
worktrees share one machine-global queue. Jobs are prioritized (high/normal/low)
and scheduled FIFO within priority. When you push a new commit to the same
branch, the pending job for the old SHA is automatically replaced — but
narrower reruns (just one failing target) and different validation modes
(smoke vs full) coexist without interfering.

**Fail-fast across targets.** If Mac fails, Shipyard stops immediately —
it doesn't waste time running Windows and Linux when you already know
you need to fix something. Remaining targets are marked as skipped. When
you want to run everything regardless (to see the full picture), use
`--continue`.

**Targeted re-runs.** If Windows fails but Mac and Linux passed, re-run just
Windows. Shipyard keeps the evidence from the earlier run. When the re-run
passes, all three platforms now have green evidence for this SHA — you don't
re-validate what already passed.

**Stage-aware resume.** If your build succeeded but tests failed, you don't
need to rebuild from scratch. Use `--resume-from test` to skip configure and
build, running only the test stage. This works because Shipyard runs
validation in stages (configure → build → test) and tracks which stage
failed — so both you and your agent know exactly what broke and where to
pick up.

**Failover that knows the difference.** If a target is unreachable, Shipyard
walks your fallback chain (boot VM → try cloud → try GitHub-hosted). But if
your code genuinely fails a test, there's no fallback — a real test failure
is authoritative. The result always records exactly which backend produced it,
so you know whether proof came from your local Mac or a Namespace runner.

**Transient failure retry.** SSH connections drop. Shipyard recognizes 9
transient SSH error patterns (connection reset, timeout, kex failure) and
retries with exponential backoff before triggering fallback. Permanent errors
like `Permission denied` fail immediately — no wasted retries.

**22 ecosystem detectors.** `shipyard init` recognizes CMake, Swift, Xcode,
Rust, Go, Node.js (pnpm > bun > yarn > npm), Python (uv > poetry > pip),
Gradle, Maven, .NET, Flutter, Dart, Deno, Ruby, Elixir, PHP — and infers
the right build and test commands. For polyglot repos, it detects all
ecosystems with family deduplication (one Node detector, not four).

**Structured JSON on every command.** Every command supports `--json` with a
versioned schema (`schema_version: 1`). Agents parse the output directly —
no screen-scraping, no fragile regex. The schema version increments when the
format changes, so agents can check compatibility.

**Target profiles for instant switching.** Define `local`, `normal`, and
`full` profiles once. Switch with `shipyard config use local` — no config
editing. Each profile activates a different set of targets. Global profiles
work across all projects; project profiles override for specific needs.
(See *Security & Governance Profiles* below for the separate set of
profiles that control branch protection, release flow, and reviewer
requirements.)

**Merge only when proven.** `shipyard ship` refuses to merge unless every
required platform has passing evidence for the exact HEAD SHA. It checks
per-platform, so one missing or failing platform blocks the merge with a
clear breakdown of what's passing, missing, and failing.

**Operational cleanup.** Logs, bundles, and results don't grow forever.
`shipyard cleanup` shows what can be reclaimed (dry-run by default). The
queue automatically trims to the 25 most recent completed jobs.

---

## Security & Governance Profiles

Shipyard manages a project's GitHub-side governance settings —
branch protection on `main`, tag protection on release tags, default
workflow token permissions, release approval gates — declaratively from
`.shipyard/config.toml`. Pick a profile, run `shipyard governance apply`,
and the live GitHub state matches the profile. Drift between the declared
config and the live state is reported by `shipyard governance status`.

### Pick a profile

```toml
# .shipyard/config.toml
[project]
profile = "solo"   # one of: solo, multi, custom
```

The two presets cover the most common shapes: a single maintainer who
takes occasional third-party PRs, and a multi-contributor team with real
review requirements. `custom` lets you declare every knob explicitly.

### What each profile sets

| Setting | `solo` | `multi` | Why the difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Branch protection: require PR | ✅ | ✅ | Catches stray pushes either way |
| Branch protection: required status checks | ✅ (configured) | ✅ (configured) | The whole point of CI |
| Branch protection: strict status checks | ❌ | ✅ | Solo doesn't need rebase coordination |
| Branch protection: required reviews | 0 | 1 | Solo can't review their own PR |
| Branch protection: enforce on admins | ❌ | ✅ | Solo needs a 3 AM hotfix path |
| Branch protection: dismiss stale reviews | ❌ | ✅ | Force re-review on rebase in multi |
| Tag protection: forbid update / delete / force | ✅ | ✅ | Trivy-style attack prevention |
| Tag protection: forbid creation by non-admins | ❌ | ✅ | Solo creates release tags directly |
| Default workflow token | read | read | Both — pure win, zero friction |
| Forbid sensitive branch patterns | ❌ | ✅ | Solo has no co-maintainers to coordinate disclosure with |
| Release approval gate | `off` (or `auto`) | `manual` | Solo doesn't gain from approving themselves |
| Sigstore release attestations | ✅ | ✅ | Free, no friction, helps downstream verifiers |
| Immutable releases | ✅ | ✅ | Free, no friction |
| Action SHA pinning (Renovate) | ✅ | ✅ | Same — managed by Renovate |
| `zizmor` workflow lint in CI | ✅ | ✅ | Same — runs automatically |
| Renovate cooldown (third-party / first-party days) | 3 / 0 | 3 / 0 | Same |

The pattern: **anything that's an "attacker-side" guardrail is on for
both profiles** (free security), and **anything that's a "process
correctness" guardrail varies** (solo doesn't gain from rules that
exist to coordinate multiple humans).

### Commands

```bash
shipyard governance status         # show current matrix vs profile vs live GitHub state
shipyard governance use solo       # switch profile + apply
shipyard governance use multi      # switch profile + apply
shipyard governance diff           # what `apply` would change
shipyard governance apply          # bring live GitHub state in line with config
shipyard governance apply --create develop/foo
                                   # create branch + apply matching protection in one command
```

`status` is the rollup view that shows where things stand without
clicking through six GitHub settings pages. `use` is the one-command
profile switch. `diff` is the dry-run before any mutation. `apply` is
the idempotent apply. `apply --create <branch>` is the new-branch
flow that creates the branch from `main` and applies the matching
governance rules in one shot — branches never exist in an unprotected
state.

### Inspired by Astral

The governance profiles, the action SHA pinning workflow, the tag
protection, immutable releases, default read-only workflow tokens, and
the deployment approval pattern all follow practices documented in
[Astral's open-source security post](https://astral.sh/blog/open-source-security-at-astral).
Astral built and maintains uv, Ruff, and ty — millions of developers
depend on those tools, so they had to figure out the security baseline
for cross-platform Python tooling under real attacker pressure. The
post is the canonical reference for *why* each of these settings
matters, and Shipyard packages the *how* into a one-command profile
switch so you don't have to figure it out from first principles.

Pulp ([github.com/danielraffel/pulp](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp))
is the first project to adopt Shipyard's governance profile system.
Pulp runs on the `solo` profile because it has a single maintainer
today; the same `.shipyard/config.toml` would gain a `[project] profile
= "multi"` line and a `shipyard governance use multi` invocation if it
ever grew co-maintainers, with no other config changes.

### What ships in which Shipyard release

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Multi-backend executor dispatch (local / SSH / Windows-SSH / cloud) | ✅ v0.1.2 |
| Submission preflight + reachability probe | ✅ v0.1.2 |
| Cloud commands (`workflows`, `defaults`, `run`, `status`) | ✅ v0.1.2 |
| Streaming progress + heartbeats + phase markers | ✅ v0.1.2 |
| Validation contract markers (configurable, enforced) | 🚧 Phase 5 (v0.1.3) |
| Prepared-state reuse on warm validation | 🚧 Phase 5 (v0.1.3) |
| Windows host mutex + VS instance auto-detection | 🚧 Phase 5 (v0.1.3) |
| SSH unreachable → Namespace cloud auto-failover | 🚧 Phase 5 (v0.1.3) |
| `shipyard governance status / use / diff / apply` | 🚧 Phase 6 (v0.1.4) |
| `shipyard governance apply --create <branch>` | 🚧 Phase 6 (v0.1.4) |
| Awaiting-approval surface in `shipyard ship --watch` | 🚧 Phase 6 (v0.1.4) |
| Sigstore attestations on Shipyard's own releases | 🚧 Planned |
| zizmor in Shipyard's own CI | 🚧 Planned |

The currently-shipped feature set is enough to dogfood Shipyard against
a real project today. The Phase 5 / Phase 6 work closes the remaining
capability gaps with feature-complete `local_ci.py` and adds the
governance profile system.

## Examples

### What your project needs

Shipyard runs your existing build and test commands on each platform. It
assumes your project already has:

- A build system (CMake, Xcode, Cargo, npm, Gradle, Swift, etc.)
- Test commands that exit 0 on success and non-zero on failure

If your project builds and has tests, Shipyard can validate it. If it
doesn't have tests yet, Shipyard still validates that the build succeeds.

---

### Scenario 1: You're building a macOS and iOS app

You have an Xcode project. You want to make sure it builds and tests pass
on your Mac before merging. Both targets run locally — no VMs or cloud needed.

```
$ shipyard init

Detecting project...
  Found: MyApp.xcodeproj (Xcode project)
  Platforms detected: macOS, iOS

What platforms do you want to validate?
  [x] macOS    (local Mac — Xcode 16.2 found)
  [x] iOS      (local simulator — iPhone 16 Pro available)

Writing .shipyard/config.toml... done
```

Now every time you run `shipyard run`, it builds and tests on your Mac:

```
$ shipyard run
  macos   = pass  (local, 1m42s)     ← built and tested on your Mac
  ios-sim = pass  (local, 2m15s)     ← ran on the local iOS simulator
  All green.
```

Both targets say `local` because everything runs on your machine. No network,
no VMs, no cloud accounts needed. This is the simplest Shipyard setup.

---

### Scenario 2: You're building a cross-platform audio plugin

You're using JUCE, Pulp, or another C++ framework. Your plugin needs to
compile and pass tests on macOS, Windows, and Linux — because DAW users are
on all three.

You have UTM running a Windows 11 VM and an Ubuntu VM on your Mac. Shipyard
detects them and uses SSH to send your code to each one:

```
$ shipyard init

Detecting project...
  Found: CMakeLists.txt (CMake C++ project)
  Platforms detected: macOS, Windows, Linux

What platforms do you want to validate?
  [x] macOS    (local Mac)
  [x] Windows  (SSH host "win" — reachable, 23ms)
  [x] Linux    (SSH host "ubuntu" — reachable, 847ms)

Cloud failover: fall back to Namespace when VMs are down? [Y/n]

Writing .shipyard/config.toml... done
```

When you run validation, your Mac builds locally while your VMs build over SSH
— all three in parallel:

```
$ shipyard run
  mac     = pass  (local, 3m12s)     ← built on your Mac
  windows = pass  (ssh, 5m30s)       ← built on your Windows VM via SSH
  ubuntu  = pass  (ssh, 4m18s)       ← built on your Ubuntu VM via SSH
  All green.
```

If your VMs are powered off or unreachable, Shipyard automatically falls back
to Namespace cloud runners — you don't have to do anything:

```
$ shipyard run
  mac     = pass  (local, 3m12s)
  windows → SSH unreachable → dispatching to Namespace...
          = pass  (namespace-failover, 8m45s)    ← cloud runner took over
  ubuntu  = pass  (ssh, 4m18s)
  All green.
```

---

### Scenario 3: You're building a macOS desktop app with agents running in parallel in multiple worktrees

Single platform, single machine. You still get Shipyard's queue (so agents running in parallel in multiple
worktrees don't collide), evidence tracking (so you know what SHA last
passed), and one-command merge:

```
$ shipyard init

Detecting project...
  Found: Package.swift (Swift package)
  Platforms detected: macOS

Writing .shipyard/config.toml... done

$ shipyard run
  macos = pass  (local, 45s)

$ shipyard ship
  Created PR #7. Validated. Merged.
```

If you later need Windows or Linux builds, just add targets — no re-init:

```
$ shipyard targets add ubuntu
  SSH host "ubuntu" — reachable. Added.
```

---

### Scenario 4: You're building a cross-platform Tauri app

Tauri apps ship native Rust binaries on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Shipyard
validates all three in parallel:

```
$ shipyard init

Detecting project...
  Found: Cargo.toml (Rust project)
  Found: package.json (Node.js frontend)
  Found: src-tauri/ (Tauri app detected)
  Platforms detected: macOS, Windows, Linux

Writing .shipyard/config.toml... done

$ shipyard run
  mac     = pass  (local, 2m08s)
  ubuntu  = pass  (ssh, 3m45s)
  windows → SSH unreachable → booting VM "Windows 11"...
          = pass  (utm-fallback, 6m30s)    ← Shipyard booted the VM automatically
  All green.
```

The Windows VM was asleep. Shipyard booted it via UTM, waited for SSH to come
up, ran the build, and reported the result.

---

## How Targets Work

A target is a real machine where your code gets validated. You name them
whatever you want and can have as many as you need:

| Target name | Platform | Backend | What it is |
|------------|----------|---------|------------|
| `mac` | macos-arm64 | local | Your Apple Silicon Mac |
| `mac-intel` | macos-x64 | local | Your Intel Mac (if you have one) |
| `ubuntu` | linux-x64 | ssh | Ubuntu VM running on your Mac |
| `ubuntu-arm` | linux-arm64 | ssh | ARM64 Linux server |
| `windows` | windows-x64 | ssh | Windows VM running on your Mac |
| `cloud-linux` | linux-x64 | cloud | A Namespace runner |

You don't need all of these. Use what matches your project — one target
is fine, six is fine. Add more any time with `shipyard targets add`.

### What happens when a machine is down

Each target can have a fallback chain. When the primary is unreachable,
Shipyard tries the next option automatically:

```
1. Try SSH to your VM → unreachable (VM is off)
2. Boot the VM via UTM → wait for SSH to come up → success
3. If that also fails → dispatch to Namespace cloud runners
4. If cloud fails too → dispatch to GitHub-hosted runners (last resort)
```

The chain is configurable per target. You can skip VMs, skip cloud, 
or make cloud the primary. An indie developer just having a play with
a project might use: local first, VM fallback, cloud last resort.

### What Shipyard checks on setup

`shipyard doctor` checks what you have and tells you what's missing:

```
$ shipyard doctor

  Core:
    ✓ git 2.44.0
    ✓ ssh (OpenSSH 9.7)

  Cloud providers:
    ✓ gh 2.62.0 (authenticated as danielraffel)
    ✗ nsc — not installed
      → Install with: brew install namespace-cli

  SSH targets:
    ✓ ubuntu — reachable (847ms)
    ✗ windows — unreachable
      → Check: ssh win

  Overall: ready (1 optional item missing)
```

If something is missing, Shipyard tells you exactly what to install and how.
In the future, `shipyard doctor --fix` will offer to install missing tools
for you.

---

## Agent Integration

### `shipyard init` handles this for you

When you run `shipyard init`, it detects whether you’re using Claude Code
or Codex and offers to set up agent integration automatically:

```
$ shipyard init

  ...detecting project, configuring targets...

  Agent setup:
    Found: Claude Code (.claude/ directory detected)

    How should your agent handle merging?
      [1] Auto-merge — agent validates and merges to main automatically
      [2] Auto-merge to develop — agent merges to develop, you promote to main
      [3] Validate only — agent runs CI, you click merge manually
      [4] Skip agent setup

  Choice [1]: 1

  → Writing .claude/skills/ci.md
  → Adding CI instructions to CLAUDE.md

  Done. Your agent will now validate and merge automatically.
```

You don’t need to copy files or edit configs. Init writes the right files
for your choice. You can re-run `shipyard init` later to change the setup.

### How it works after setup

Once configured, your agent handles CI end-to-end:

1. You: "Implement the reverb effect and ship it"
2. Agent writes code, commits to a feature branch
3. Agent runs `shipyard ship` which:
   - Pushes the branch
   - Creates a PR
   - Validates on all configured platforms
   - If all green, merges automatically
4. You come back, it’s on main

This is how [Pulp](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp) (the project
Shipyard was extracted from) operates daily.

### If you prefer manual merging

Option 3 during init sets up "validate only" — the agent runs
`shipyard run` to validate, but doesn’t merge. You review the PR and
click squash-and-merge yourself. You still get cross-platform validation
without giving up control over what lands on main.

### Merging to develop instead of main

Option 2 during init sets up a develop branch flow. Agents merge to
`develop` automatically. You promote `develop` to `main` when ready:

```bash
git checkout develop
shipyard ship --base main    # validate develop, merge to main
```

### What init writes

Depending on your choice, init creates:

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `.claude/skills/ci.md` | Teaches Claude how to validate and ship |
| `CLAUDE.md` addition | CI instructions for Claude |
| `AGENTS.md` addition | CI instructions for Codex |

These are standard files in your repo. You can edit them, version them,
or delete them. Nothing hidden.

---

## Workflow Scenarios

<details>
<summary><strong>CLI workflows for manual use and troubleshooting</strong></summary>

<br>

Most of the time your agent handles CI automatically. These scenarios are
for when you want to run things manually, debug a failure, or manage the
queue.

### You finished a feature and want to merge

You've been working on a feature branch. Everything looks good. Time to
validate across platforms and merge.

```
$ shipyard run
  mac     = pass  (local, 3m12s)
  ubuntu  = pass  (ssh, 5m30s)
  windows = pass  (ssh, 4m18s)
  All green.

$ shipyard ship
  PR #42 created → Validated → Merged to main
```

Or in one step: `shipyard ship` does the validation and merge together.

### CI fails on one platform

You ran validation and Windows failed. You don't want to re-validate
macOS and Linux (they already passed) — just fix and re-run Windows.

```
$ shipyard run
  mac = pass, ubuntu = pass, windows = FAIL

$ shipyard logs sy-001 --target windows
  MSVC error C2065: 'M_PI' undeclared in reverb.cpp:42

# Fix the issue, commit
$ shipyard run --targets windows
  windows = pass

$ shipyard ship
  PR #42 → Merged
```

Shipyard remembers the evidence from the previous run. When you re-run
just Windows and it passes, all three platforms now have green evidence
for this SHA.

### Multiple agents working in parallel

You have two agents working in separate worktrees — one on reverb,
one on delay. Both need CI, and your machine has one Windows VM.

Shipyard's queue handles this automatically. The first agent's run starts
immediately. The second agent's run queues behind it. When the first
finishes, the second starts.

```
Agent 1 (worktree: ~/Code/my-plugin-reverb):
  shipyard ship → queued → running → PR #42 merged

Agent 2 (worktree: ~/Code/my-plugin-delay):
  shipyard ship → queued → waiting → running → PR #43 merged
```

No collisions. No manual coordination. The queue is machine-global.

### Prioritizing one job over another

Two jobs are queued. The delay feature is urgent. Bump it up.

```
$ shipyard queue
  Running: sy-001 feature/reverb  [normal]
  Pending: sy-002 feature/delay   [low]

$ shipyard bump sy-002 high
  Bumped sy-002 to high
```

When the current job finishes, the high-priority job runs next.

### Merging to develop, not main

Your team uses a develop branch as a staging area. Ship to develop first,
promote to main later when stable.

```
$ shipyard ship --base develop
  PR #44 → Validated → Merged to develop

# Later, when develop is stable:
$ git checkout develop
$ shipyard ship --base main
  PR #45 → Validated → Merged to main
```

</details>

## Install

### For Claude Code users (recommended)

Install the Shipyard plugin. It gives you natural language CI commands
and will prompt to install the CLI binary if it's not already on your
machine.

**Step 1:** Add the Shipyard marketplace to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "shipyard": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "danielraffel/Shipyard"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2:** Install the plugin in Claude Code:

```
/plugin install shipyard@shipyard
```

**Step 3:** Set up your project:

```
/shipyard:init
```

The plugin uses the CLI under the hood. If the `shipyard` binary isn't
installed, the plugin will detect that and offer to install it for you.

### For Codex / CLI users

### Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://generouscorp.com/Shipyard/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads a standalone binary for your platform. No runtime needed.

| OS | Architecture | Binary |
|----|-------------|--------|
| macOS | Apple Silicon (ARM64) | `shipyard-macos-arm64` |
| macOS | Intel (x64) | `shipyard-macos-x64` |
| Windows | x64 | `shipyard-windows-x64.exe` |
| Linux | x64 | `shipyard-linux-x64` |
| Linux | ARM64 | `shipyard-linux-arm64` |

### Build from source (for contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielraffel/Shipyard.git
cd Shipyard
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                         # verify everything works
```

### Requirements

You don't need everything — just what matches your setup:

| Tool | Required? | What it's for | Install |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) | Yes | Version control | Pre-installed on macOS |
| [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) | Yes (for PRs) | GitHub integration | `brew install gh` |
| `ssh` | For remote targets | Connect to VMs | Pre-installed on macOS not on [Ubuntu / etc](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/how-to/security/openssh-server/) / [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui&pivots=windows-11) |
| [nsc](https://namespace.so/docs/reference/cli/installation) | For [Namespace](https://namespace.so) | Cloud runners | `brew install namespace-cli` |
| [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) / [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) | For VM fallback | Auto-boot VMs | `brew install --cask utm` |

`shipyard doctor` checks all of this and tells you what's missing.

## Profiles

Once you're comfortable with Shipyard, profiles let you switch between
different setups with one command.

### The problem they solve

Some days you want local-only validation (fast, free). Other days you need
the full cross-platform proof (Mac + Windows + Linux via cloud). Editing
your config every time is annoying.

### Define profiles once

```toml
# .shipyard/config.toml

[profiles.local]
# Just your Mac. Fast. Free. No network.
targets = ["mac"]

[profiles.normal]
# Mac local + cloud for Windows and Linux
targets = ["mac", "ubuntu-cloud", "windows-cloud"]

[profiles.full]
# Mac local + VMs with cloud fallback for everything
targets = ["mac", "ubuntu", "windows"]
```

### Switch instantly

```bash
$ shipyard config use local          # just my Mac
$ shipyard config use normal         # Mac + Namespace cloud
$ shipyard config use full           # Mac + VMs + cloud fallback
```

### See what's active

```bash
$ shipyard config profiles

  local     mac                                          ← active
  normal    mac, ubuntu-cloud, windows-cloud
  full      mac, ubuntu, windows (+fallback)

$ shipyard targets

  Profile: local

  mac              local        macos-arm64      reachable

  (ubuntu and windows are disabled in this profile)
```

### Global vs project profiles

Profiles work at both levels:

- **Global** (`~/.config/shipyard/config.toml`) — your default setups, shared
  across all projects. Define `local`, `normal`, `full` here once.
- **Project** (`.shipyard/config.toml`) — project-specific profiles that
  override or extend global ones. A project that needs ARM Linux testing
  can add a `release` profile with extra targets.

Switch profiles globally or per-project. `shipyard status` always shows
which profile is active and exactly where each target will run.

### Fallback is opt-in

By default, if a target is unreachable, it just reports unreachable. No
automatic VM booting, no cloud dispatch. You add fallback chains only if
you want them:

```toml
# No fallback — unreachable means unreachable
[targets.ubuntu]
backend = "ssh"
host = "ubuntu"

# With fallback — tries VM, then cloud
[targets.ubuntu]
backend = "ssh"
host = "ubuntu"
fallback = [
    { type = "vm", vm_name = "Ubuntu 24.04" },
    { type = "cloud", provider = "namespace" },
]
```

This keeps things predictable. You always know exactly what Shipyard will
do because you configured it.

## This Repo Uses Shipyard

Shipyard validates and ships itself. The config is at
[`.shipyard/config.toml`](.shipyard/config.toml):

```toml
[project]
name = "shipyard"
type = "python"
platforms = ["macos", "linux", "windows"]

[validation.default]
command = "pip install -e '.[dev]' && pytest && ruff check src/"

[targets.mac]
backend = "local"
platform = "macos-arm64"
```

The CI workflow at [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
runs tests on macOS, Linux, and Windows on every push. The release workflow
at [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds
binaries on 5 platforms when a version is tagged.

```bash
# How we validate
shipyard run                    # runs pytest + ruff on local Mac

# How we release
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0          # triggers binary builds on 5 platforms
                                # → GitHub Release with binaries + checksums
```

218 tests. 0.3 seconds. The release builds itself.
